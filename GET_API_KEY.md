2. Give it a name: `photo-booth-app`
3. Select role: **"Read"** (this is free!)
4. Click **"Generate token"**
5. **COPY THE TOKEN** - it starts with `hf_...`

## Step 3: I'll Configure It For You

Once you have the token:
1. **Copy it** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Tell me** "I have the token" or just paste it here
3. I'll automatically create the `.env` file and add it for you!
